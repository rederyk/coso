# 💬 Conversation Notes

## Key Decisions

### RAG Memory System
- Proposed by user: "rag primitivo" (primitive RAG)
- Need: Space for AI to read/write persistent knowledge
- Solution: `/memory/` directory with structured knowledge files
- Files: user_profile, project_context, task_history, code_snippets, conversation_notes

### WebDataManager Roadmap Updates
- User: "conbtrol teh roadmap update it based on ral code a nd continue it"
- Action: Session 3 completed with Lua integration
- Focus: Real code verification, roadmap updates, continuation planning
- Pattern: Build verification required before proceeding

### System Architecture Preferences
- User prefers simple, direct systems over complex solutions
- Appreciation for primitive but functional approaches
- Focus on utility and maintainability over elegance

## Important Context Points

### Working Style
- User values clear progress tracking and verification steps
- Prefers concise, technical communication
- Enjoys systematic problem solving with clear milestones

### Project Priorities
- Weather Widget: Immediate functional requirement
- Lua scripting: Primary integration mechanism
- Dashboard UI: Central user interaction point
- Testing/Refinement: Quality assurance focus

### Future Possibilities Discussed
- News feed widgets
- Custom API integration
- Data visualization
- Home automation expansion
- Voice assistant data queries

## Current Focus Areas
- Completion of Session 5: Testing & Documentation
- Memory system establishment for continued learning
- Potential home automation data source integrations
- Voice command expansion for data management

## Notes for Future Reference
- Weather widget uses Open-Meteo API with Milan coordinates
- LVGL threading requires careful mutex management
- WebDataManager integrates seamlessly with voice assistant Lua bridge
- Project builds successfully with ~20% RAM usage margin
